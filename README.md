# Checkers-Elemental-Duel

The project focuses on creating a strategic and adaptive AI opponent forÂ Checkers: Elemental Duel, a variant of traditional Checkers where each piece has an elemental affinity (e.g., fire, water, earth, air). The game introduces a rock-paper-scissors mechanic for piece interactions, adding a layer of complexity and strategy to the classic game.
